The Berneout Pledge

First Edition, First Draft

Contributors to projects published under free-of-charge public licenses, or "free public projects", follow unwritten rules about licensing and contribution.  They expect others to do so, too.  I make this pledge to make those unwritten rules, and the fact that I follow them, explicit.

Unless I specifically say otherwise in a contribution, whenever I make a contribution to a free public project, I license my contribution under the same license terms on which that project is licensed to the public at the time.

I am aware of legal rules, like "work made for hire" rules, that may give employers, clients, and others ownership of intellectual property in work that I do.  I am also aware that legal agreements I make may transfer ownership of intellectual property rights in my work to others.

I pledge not to offer contributions to free public projects that I know may be subject to others' intellectual property rights without their written, legally binding permission.  When I offer a contribution with permission, I pledge to make public, as part of my contribution, who may own rights, the fact they gave permission, and how they gave permission.

This pledge applies to all my contributions for one year, starting at 2016-04-18T01:37+0000.

I may revoke this pledge earlier by cryptographically signing a copy of The Berneout Pledge Revocation, First Edition, First Draft, with the same private key, and posting it to berneout.org.
